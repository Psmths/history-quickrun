# history-quickrun
 Quickly find and run past commands from bash history. This is a python script that will take user input and use regular expressions to match it to commands found in your bash history. It will then return an enumerated list of the commands it found and allow you to run the one you were looking for instead of abusing the up arrow key.

 # Usage
```
./hr 'partial command'
```
